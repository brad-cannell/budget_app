# Notes for My Personal Budget App

Created: 2023-01-01   
Updated: `r Sys.Date()`

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

This private repository is for my personal budget app. This is really experimental at this point.

# Instructions

1. Use NOTES for notes, but not for tasks. _Why_ or _how_, but _not what_. For now, I'm making this a **private** repository. Because it's a private repository, GitHub won't allow me to create a wiki. For now, I will use README like a wiki.

2. Create and manage tasks in the [GitHub project](). That way they are tracked, versioned, easy to find, easy to share, and hard to lose over time.

# Project overview

I'm trying to create a Shiny application that I can use to track and pay bills. Ideally, this application will replace the [Google Sheet that I'm currently using](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1WwseDMbA9OTkwhb51wMKgJfVlayhp-j65tf7MYfwhZ4/edit#gid=1109763561).

## Why go to the trouble of doing this?

1. For the experience. I still haven't built many Shiny applications. This feels like a good way for me to get experience in a low-stakes environment.
   
2. Potential advantages of this method over the spreadsheets I've been using.

    - Data storage is separated from data entry/management. This makes errors less likely to occur.
    
    - Dashboards. I should be able to more easily create dashboards with R that allow me to get more actionable information out of my budget.
    
    - Tracking over time. It should be easier to track my budget over time (i.e., across years) with this method than with separate yearly workbooks.

# Design and formatting

## Databse vs CSV data tables

Eventually, I may want to use SQLite or something for data storage. However, there will be a little bit of a learning curve for me to go that route. For now, I will start by building the app with flat files. Later, I may decided to move the data over to a database of some sort.
